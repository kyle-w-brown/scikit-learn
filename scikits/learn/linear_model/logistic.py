class LogisticRegression(BaseLibLinear, ClassifierMixin):
    """
    Logistic Regression.

    Implements L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression.

    Parameters
    ----------

    penalty : string, 'l1' or 'l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization

    dual : boolean
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only
        implemented for l2 penalty.

    C : float
        Specifies the strength of the regularization. The smaller it is
        the bigger in the regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default: True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added the decision function

    Attributes
    ----------

    `coef_` : array, shape = [n_classes-1, n_features]
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

    `intercept_` : array, shape = [n_classes-1]
        intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.
        It is available only when parameter intercept is set to True

    LinearSVC

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
    select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
    to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
    that happens, try with a smaller eps parameter.
